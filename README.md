## ESLint and Prettier

This project enforces code quality and consistent formatting using ESLint and Prettier.

### ESLint

To lint the code, run:

```sh
   npm run lint
```

This will identify and potentially fix any linting errors in the codebase.

### Prettier

Prettier is set up to ensure that code is formatted consistently. It works seamlessly with ESLint.

To format the codebase, run:
```sh
npm run format
```


(Note: This command assumes you've set up a `format` script in `package.json` to run Prettier.)

We recommend integrating Prettier with your editor for on-the-fly formatting. For more information, check out [Prettier's editor integration guide](https://prettier.io/docs/en/editors.html).
